### conditions for well posedness
a. There exists at least one solution
b. There exists at most one solution - an example for diffusion equation using the [[Uniqueness#Uniqueness of Diffusion equation|energy method]]
c. The solution depends continuously on the data - A small error in the data entails a small error in the solution. To prove this we can derive useful inequalities such as the minimum/maximum principles in the [[Maximum Principles#Results and corollaries|Results and corollaries]] section of the Maximum principles notes.
