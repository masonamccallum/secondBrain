$\forall \;f\in\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$  we have the functional $\braket{f,\varphi}\;\;\forall\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$

In the theory of [[Generalized Functions|generalized functions]] we see that the class of distributions $\mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ generated by the space of compactly supported and bounded test function space $\mathcal{D}$. We now could consider the space of distributions $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ generated by the schwartz class of functions exponentially decaying. Recall that $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)\subset\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$.  We do however conclude that $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)\subseteq \mathbb{D}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$. 

### why do we introduce tempered distributions?
We introduce the tempered distributions because we can define a Fourier transform on that space as a tempered distribution. We cannot however define a Fourier transform of all distributions $\mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ as distributions.
In the theory of generalized functions we discussed the which operators on $\mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ are closed under certain operations. We will have to make a similar argument for the Schwartz class with one caveat.  We also get a different adjoint identity from the one formed in the theory of distributions.
>[!warning] Caveat
> Multiplication by a $C^\infty$ function $m(x)$ is closed only if $m(x)\le c|x|^N$ as $x\rightarrow\infty$ for some c and N. 

#### Adjoint of tempered distributions $\mathcal{F}f$
$$f\in\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)\;:\;\braket{\hat{f},\varphi}=\braket{f,\hat{\varphi}}$$
We also find the following property
$$
\begin{aligned}
\braket{\mathcal{F}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k}f\right),\varphi}&=-\braket{f,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k}\hat{\varphi}}\\
&=-\braket{f,\mathcal{F}(ix_k\varphi)}\\
&=-\braket{\hat{f},ix_k\varphi}\\
&=\braket{-ix_k\hat{f},\varphi}\\
\end{aligned}
$$
which says that for $f\in\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ we get the following property
$$\mathcal{F}(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k}f)=-ix_k\hat{f}$$
### Convolutions of Tempered Distributions
below note $\tilde\varphi=\varphi(-x)$
Suppose we define convolution differently from in the FT table. 
$$
\psi*f(x)=\int \psi(x-y)f(y)\;dy
$$
We might write this as 
$$
\psi*f(x) = \braket{f,\tau_{-x}\tilde{\psi}}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\int\braket{f,\tau_{-x}\tilde{\psi}}\varphi(x)\;dx&=\braket{f,\int(\tau_{-x}\tilde{\psi})\varphi(x)\;dx}\\
&=\braket{f,\int\tilde{\psi}(y-x)\varphi(x)\;dx}\\
&=\braket{f,\tilde{\psi}*\varphi(y)}\\
\end{aligned}
$$
This property shows that convolution is a smoothing process. If you start with any tempered distribution, no matter how rough, and take the convolution with a test function, you get a smooth function. The most important example follows.

$$
\psi*\delta(x) = \braket{\delta,\tau_{-x}\tilde{\psi}}= \psi(x-y)|_{y=0}=\psi(x)
$$
