A function $F(x)$ that satisfied the superposition principle is called a linear function. Superposition can be defined by two simpler properties.

Additivity: $F(x_1+x_2)=F(x_1+x_2)$
Homogeneity: $F(ax)=aF(x)$ for a scaler $a$
For an appropriate operator, say the [[Diffusion Equation]] if u and v are solutions of the diffusion equation and $a,b\in\mathbb{C}$, $au+bv$ is also a solution of the equation. More generally if $u_k(\mathbf{x},t)$ is a family of solutions depending on the parameter k and g=g(k) is a function rapidly vanishing at infinity, then the following are still solutions
$$\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}u_k(\mathbf{x},t)g(\mathbf{x}) \;\;\;\;\text{and}\;\;\;\;\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}u_k(\mathbf{x},t)g(k) \;dk$$
