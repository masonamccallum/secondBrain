### Dirichlet Condition
The temperature is kept at a prescribed level on $\partial\Omega$; 
$$u(\mathbb{\sigma},t)=h(\mathbb{\sigma},t)\;\;\;\; \mathbb{\sigma}\in\partial\Omega\;\text{and}\; t\in(0,T]$$
### Neumann Condition
This corisponds to a density/heat flux prescribed through $\partial\Omega$. We assume smooth boundary and existance of a tangent line or plane at every point. 
$$\partial_\nu u(\mathbf{\sigma},t) = h(\sigma,t)\;\;\;\; \mathbb{\sigma}\in\partial\Omega\;\text{and}\; t\in(0,T]$$
### Radiation or Robin Condition
The inward (say) heat flux through $\partial\Omega$ depends linearly on the difference U-u
where U is the ambient temperature. 
$$\partial_\nu u + \alpha u = h\;\;\;\;\;\;\text{on}\;\partial\Omega\;\times\;(0,T]$$
#### Mixed conditions
It is also useful to prescribe say a dirichlet B.C on one subset of the boundary and Neuman conditions on another disjoint subset of the boundary.
