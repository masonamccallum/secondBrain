##### Example of well posed-ness (Lecture 5 PDE)
"We are going to impose a strong continuity requirement for well posedness, which generally means that the norm we measure the solution is the same norm we use to measure initial data. A weaker example of well posed-ness would be to bound our solution by a weaker norm this is an example of weak well posedness."

for a linear problem a boundedness inequality leads to continuity of our problem. i.e.
$\{g_n\}\rightarrow g\;\;\therefore \{u_n\}\rightarrow u$ 
for the diffusion equation we get the following estimate
$$
\hat{u}(\xi,t) = e^{-\eta|\xi|^2t}\hat{g}(\xi)
$$
We estimate the following Sobolev norm.
We will also use: $P_n(\xi)e^{-2\eta|\xi|^2t}\le C_m^2(t)\;\;t>0$ 
$$
\begin{aligned}
||\hat{u}(\xi,t)||_{H_m}&=(2\pi)^n\int_\mathbb{R}P_m(\xi^2)|\hat{u}|^2\\
&=(2\pi)^n\int_{\mathbb{R}}P_m(\xi^2)e^{-2\eta|\xi|^2t}|\hat{g}(\xi)|^2d\xi\\
&\le (2\pi)^n c_m^2(t)||\hat{g}||_{L_2}^2\\
&= c_m^2(t)||g||_{L_2}^2\\
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
||\hat{u}(\xi,t)||_{H_m}\le c_m(t)||g||_{L_2}
$$
"What what this shows is that when you solve the heat equation you get a solution that is much smoother than the data"  -TH

### Same analysis for Schr√∂dinger equation
$-i\frac{du}{dt}=\eta\Delta u$ we get $\frac{d\hat{u}}{dt}=-i\eta|\xi|^2\hat{u}$ 
$$\therefore\;\; \hat{u}(\xi,t)=e^{-i\eta|\xi|^2t}\hat{g}(\xi)$$
We get $||u||_{L_2}=||g||_{L_2}$ by [[Fourier Transforms#Plancherel formula|plancherel's formula]]. We cant get estimates of derivatives of our solution in terms of $L_2$ norms of our data. We could get estimates of our solution in terms of both $H_m$-norm in our solution and our data.

#### Analysis for wave equation
$$
\begin{cases}
&\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}=c^2\Delta u\\
&u(x,0) = g(x)\\
&\dot{u}(x,0)=h(x)\\
\end{cases}
$$
We take the Fourier transform to get the following
$$
\begin{cases}
&\hat{\ddot{u}}=-c^2|\xi|^2\hat{u}\\
&\hat{u}(\xi,0)=\hat{g}(x)\\
&\hat{\dot{u}}(\xi,0)=\hat{h}(x)\\
\end{cases}
$$
We get the following
$$
\hat{u}(\xi,t) = cos(c|\xi|t)\hat{g}(x)+ \frac{sin(c|\xi|t)}{c|\xi|}\hat{h}(\xi)
$$
We can get strong well posed-ness found as the following
$||u||_{L_2}\le||g||_{2}+t||h||_2$
We will look at this function in imaginary exponentials so we get the following
$$
\hat{u}(\xi,t)=\left(\frac{\hat{g}(\xi)}{2}+\frac{\hat{h}(\xi)}{2ic\xi}\right)e^{ic|\xi|t}+\left(\frac{\hat{g}(\xi)}{2}-\frac{\hat{h}(\xi)}{2ic|\xi|}\right)e^{-ic|\xi|t}
$$
call this coefficient of the first term $A(\xi)$ and the second coefficient $B(\xi)$ 
$$u(x,t)=(2\pi)^{-n}\int_\mathbb{R} A(\xi)e^{i(\xi\cdot x+c|\xi|t)}+B(\xi)e^{i(\xi\cdot x-c|\xi|t)}d\xi$$ 
let $\xi=|\xi|\omega$ 

$$u(x,t)=(2\pi)^{-n}\int_\mathbb{R} A(\xi)e^{i\xi(\omega\cdot x+ct)}+B(\xi)e^{i\xi(\omega\cdot x-ct)}d\xi$$ 
These are plane wave solutions of the wave equation. There is no Variation in space along the hyperplane with normal $\omega$.
