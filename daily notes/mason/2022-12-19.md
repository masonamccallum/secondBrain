- [x] Duhamel's Method
- [x] finish Fourier transforms
- [ ] read Quantum book
- [x]  what is a housedorf space??
- [x]  Multiindex notation

Tomorrow TODO
- [ ] read PDE Hagstrom notes (left off on lecture 4)
- [ ] Write up practice problems for section 1
- [ ] Fourier Series of Tempered Distributions

[[Fourier Transforms]]

Learning cool things about Obsidian. This is a great way to add practice questions!!

>[!question]+ Practice Question (Maximum Principle)
> __Problem 1.2.8__ : (Maximum principle). Let $u$ be a solution to
> $$\begin{cases}
> &u_t(x,t)-u_{xx}(x,t)=0&0<x<1,t>0\\ 	
> &u(x,0)=sin(\pi x)&0\le x\le1\\ 	
> &u(0,t)=2te^{1-t}&t>0,\\ 	
> &u(1,t)=1-cos(\pi t)&t>0,\\ 	
> \end{cases}$$
> that is continuous on the closure of the half-strip $S=(0,1)\times (0,\infty)$
> a. prove that $u$ is non-negative
> b. Determine an upper bound for $u(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ and $u(\frac{1}{2},3)$
>>[!TIP]- solution
>> a. the parabolic boundary $\partial_p S$ of the strip is a union of the half-lines ...
>> b. by the maximum principle ...
>> $$
>> \{0\le x\le 1, t=0\}\cup ...
>> $$
