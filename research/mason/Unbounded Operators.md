An unbounded operator A on H is a linear map from a dense subspace 
$A:Dom(A)\subset H\rightarrow H$. The operators we look at in Quantum theory are not necessarily bounded. the notion of self-adjoint is more complicated for these unbounded operators
### Self-adjoint unbounded operators
we seek sufficient conditions to apply the [[Spectral Theorem]] to unbounded operators. The simple condition that a compact operator A be self-adjoint $\braket{\phi,A\varphi}=\braket{A\phi,\varphi}$  is not sufficient  to apply the spectral theorem to our unbounded operators. Because our unbounded operators are not typically not compact.
 
for an unbounded operator $A$ we define the adjoint $A^*$, which is an unbounded operators with its own domain. An unbounded operators is defined to be self-adjoint if the domain of $A$ and $A^*$ are the same and $A$ and $A^*$ agree where they are defined.
