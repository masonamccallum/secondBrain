## Abstract summary 
the aim of this paper is to compute the discrete spectrum and associated bound states of semi-infinite hamiltonians. The method is to compute the Greens function of the semi-infinite hamiltonian by imposing an appropriate boundary condition in the bulk direction; then the spectral data is recovered via the [[Riesz projection]].
