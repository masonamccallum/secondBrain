The essential spectrum of a self-adjoint operator T on the Hilbert space X, denoted $\sigma_{ess}(T)$ is the set of all complex numbers $\lambda$ such that $T-\lambda I_X$ is not a Fredholm operator.
An operator is Fredholm if its Kernel and cokernel are finite-dimensional.
spps
the spectrum of T is denoted $sp(T)$ and is defined by $$sp(T)=\{\alpha\in\mathbb{F}:T-\alpha I \text{ is not invertible}\}$$
The essential spectrum is a subset of the spectrum $\sigma$, and its complement is called the discrete spectrum.
$$\sigma_{disc}(T)=\sigma(T)\setminus\sigma_{ess}(T)$$
