__Definition__: Points $x$ and $y$ in a topological space $X$ can be separated by neighborhoods if there exists neighborhoods $U$ of $x$ and $V$ of $y$ such that $U\cap V=\emptyset$. $X$ is a Housdorff space if any two distinct points in $X$ are separated by neighborhoods. This is sometimes called a separated space.

#### Properties
- subspaces and products of Hausdorff spaces are Haussdorff
- Compact sets of a Hausdorff space are always closed
- let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a continuous function and suppose $Y$ is Haussdorff. Then the graph of $f, \{(x,f(x))|x\in X\}$, is a closed subset of $X \times Y$. This reminds me of the [[Closed Graph Theorem| closed graph theorem]] from analysis
