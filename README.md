This repository is a notes set for SMU mathematics PhD qualification exams.
Goals
- Reduce redundancy in notes
- Optimize study time
- develop rich connections between course material
- define a simple structure that the project maintains.
- define a structure that is easy to add to. The challange of note taking should not be in using the pen but rather in developing nauanced links to prior knowledge. 
- Workable collaboration via github

# Why and how to take Obsidian notes?
For this usecase it is advantagous to develop connections between course material. Obsidian Stores notes in a Graph organization structure. Links between nodes in a graph help develop a network of information. A complete set of notes on our courses will involve a large amount of linking. This reduces redundancy and helps make connetions between different fields of mathematics. Many Theorems/Results of Measure Theory are useful in Dynamical system 2 or Stocastic Differential equations. Maximum principles, Lax Milgram, and the like are all topics covered in Analysis, PDE, and FEM.   

# project templates
This list defines the atomic structure of this project. Developers are responsible for appropriately linking notes via effective tags and embedding.

#### definitions
If a definition contains another defined word appropriate linking should be done
#### Theorem notes
Along with a theorem statement. It should include a colapsable proof and list of important results.
#### Practice problems/examples
These aught to include collapsable solutions but are not required. 
#### conseptual note
This note serves as the connective structure of the project. Suppose you create a conseptual note on Grahm Schmit. This could reference definitions, textbooks, or lectures from a number of courses. First create the definition/theorem files and them embed them in a conseptual note with supporting notes.
