This repository is a notes set for SMU mathematics PhD qualification exams.
Goals
- Reduce redundancy in notes
- Optimize study time
- develop rich connections between course material
- define a simple structure that the project maintains.
- define a structure that is easy to add to. The challange of note taking should not be in using the pen but rather in developing nauanced links to prior knowledge. 
- Workable collaboration via github

## What courses are supported in this repo?
Feel free to extend this list. These are the current courses in progress. 
#### Partial differential equations
profossor: Thomas Hagstrom
Textbook: Sandro Salsa's Partial Differential equations in Action
supporting material: This textbook has a problems set companion book that is great

#### Analysis
professor: Johannes Tausch
Textbook: Sheldon Axler's Measure, Integration, & real analysis


# Why and how to take Obsidian notes?
For this usecase it is advantagous to develop connections between course material. Obsidian Stores notes in a Graph organization structure. Links between nodes in a graph help develop a network of information. A complete set of notes on our courses will involve a large amount of linking. This reduces redundancy and helps make connetions between different fields of mathematics. Many Theorems/Results of Measure Theory are useful in Dynamical system 2 or Stocastic Differential equations. Maximum principles, Lax Milgram, and the like are all topics covered in Analysis, PDE, and FEM.  It is not expected that this be a replication of textbook material. We aim to maximize efficiency. If a book says it well reference the page number. At the completion of course material there should be three net gains from the project
1. Definitions and Theorems should be printable for flashcard studying
2. Conseptual notes should be readable for larger picture reading/context development
3. Connections between course material should be maximized
4. Practice problems should be extensive with complete solutions.


# project templates
This list defines the atomic structure of this project. Developers are responsible for appropriately linking notes via effective tags and embedding.

#### definitions
If a definition contains another defined word appropriate linking should be done
#### Theorem notes
Along with a theorem statement. It should include a colapsable proof and list of important results.
#### Practice problems/examples
These aught to include collapsable solutions but are not required. 
#### conseptual note
This note serves as the connective structure of the project. Suppose you create a conseptual note on Grahm Schmit. This could reference definitions, textbooks, or lectures from a number of courses. First create the definition/theorem files and them embed them in a conseptual note with supporting notes. 

# Q&A
##### What if I have a different definition/theorem with the same name but different context/assumtions?
Suppose you are defining Grahm shmidt process. But there already exists a Grahm Schmidt for function spaces. This will require an edit of the previous note. Adding the definition of Grahm schmidt on finite dimensional vector spaces will be an extention of the original note. This is similar to the structure of a wikipidia page. Subsections cover relevant differences.
